        Greetings,

        Throughout my professional journey, I've cultivated a passion for precision and efficiency. I embarked on my career as an administrative assistant, working closely with both the CEO and CFO for a span of five years. This experience ingrained in me the values of being numbers-focused, exceptionally well-organized, and unwaveringly punctual. I adeptly managed tasks ranging from payroll administration and scheduling, to meticulous data entry. This role not only honed my attention to detail but also fostered a keen understanding of the pivotal role that every cog in the corporate machinery plays.

        Currently, as a dedicated TouchPoint Manager, I've reached new heights of achievement. A testament to my prowess lies in the remarkable 30% year-over-year revenue increase I've spearheaded. In a landscape where similar showroom sales are on average ranging between -2% and 8% growth, I've consistently led the charge to not only meet but exceed expectations. When I assumed leadership of my department, it was ranked 23rd out of 24 in terms of volume and overall Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). My transformative touch shifted this ranking to the top spot for volume and a commendable second position for overall KPI performance.

        Academically, I've ventured into the realm of full stack web development, attaining a certification from the esteemed University of Texas. My journey through this program was marked by not only excellent scores in collaborative group projects but also by my proactive role as a team lead. My technical proficiency spans an impressive array of skills including REACT, NoSQL, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C++, Node.js, Hooks, and Apollo GraphSQL, among others.

        As I share this glimpse into my professional and educational journey, I'm excited to continue forging ahead in the ever-evolving landscape of business and technology. If you're seeking a dedicated professional who seamlessly blends the realms of organizational finesse and cutting-edge technical acumen, I'd be delighted to connect. Please feel free to reach out at your earliest convenience through the contact form.

        Warm regards,

        LC Sewell
